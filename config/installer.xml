    description="Archivey deletes all but the last five messages on a wave, excepting the top message. Itâ€™s meant to be used in conjunction with Pushy and any other chatty robots to keep the number of messages in a wave down to a manageable level, or as a general chat mechanic. NOTE: Robots don't currently receive events generated by other robots, so using this robot in combination with other robots is not yet supported.">
